# Wordle Game
The project is a recreation of the famous Wordle Game base on command prompt using Python

## General Info
A puzzle game where we have 6 tries to guess a five-letter word through deduction.

Game condition, each time you guess a word the letter will turn G, Y, or X to indicate if it is in the correct spot:
* G means the letter is in the right position
* Y means the letter appear somewhere in the word but not in the current position
* X mean the letter isn't in the word at all.

```
python3 main.py
